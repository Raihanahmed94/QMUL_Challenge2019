# QMUL_Challenge2019


### Business Problem
Creating a Data science capability for the Small Business Administration (SBA) to aid them in deciding whether or not to accept or reject a particular application. We are interested in general insights in terms of knowledge about the guarantees and loans given and to predict the loan will be paid in full or if it will be canceled. Are also interested in what the size of the guarantee (in percentage of the total loan amount) will have on the loan interest rate and other loan attributes.
 
We will score the challenge in three categories:
 
#### Exploration:
   * Find the most valuable/interesting insight from the dataset.
#### Prediction:
   * The most precise/accurate prediction of loan repayment.
#### Visualization:
   * The most beautiful, insightful and understandable visualization.
